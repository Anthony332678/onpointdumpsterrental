We offer 4 models, and each is designed to handle a specific volume of waste safely and efficiently.
Their straight-sided, open-top design makes it easy to toss in waste from the front, while the lids help reduce odor and keep pests out. They are also built to be lifted and emptied from the front by waste collection trucks, making them ideal for routine pickups at commercial properties, restaurants, schools, and office buildings.

Their slanted back design makes it easier for hand-loading from the rear, making them a practical choice for consistent and controlled waste disposal.
